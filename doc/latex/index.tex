This program can parse a string entered by the user. It calculates the mathematical result of the string. The program can be configured at compilation time by modifying the \hyperlink{config_8h}{config.\+h} file. By default, it uses double type to make calculation. It is possible to use the mpfr library to do the calculation, so that the precision can be defined by the user and that it can be much larger than a double precision.

\subsubsection*{Working features\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Numbers
\item Operators (+,-\/,$\ast$,/,$^\wedge$,\%, unary minus -\/, implicit multiplication \mbox{[}2pi =$>$ 2$\ast$pi\mbox{]})
\item Operator priority
\item Brackets
\item Basic mathematical functions
\item Some basic constants
\item Saving results in temporary variables
\item Use the help command to get a list of available commands
\item Calculation using double type or mpfr library (see \hyperlink{config_8h}{config.\+h} file)
\item Check entered string (function parameters, operation without operators, bracket problems, ...) (not perfect)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subparagraph*{Argument mode}

The program can be launched from a command line with multiple parameters. It will displays all the results separated by spaces and then automatically quit the program.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}calculator \char`\"{}2$\ast$5\char`\"{} \char`\"{}2+8\char`\"{}\char`\"{} (multiple calculation in a row, use quotation marks)
\item \char`\"{}calculator -\/h\char`\"{} (shortcut command)
\item \char`\"{}calculator -\/-\/help\char`\"{} (full command)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subparagraph*{\hyperlink{class_command}{Command} mode}

The program can be launched without parameters. It will then work as a bash and execute each calculation entered by the user without quitting the program. To quit, the \char`\"{}-\/q\char`\"{} command (or \char`\"{}-\/-\/exit\char`\"{}) can be used.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 2$\ast$5 2+8 (multiple calculation in a row, separated by spaces, quotation marks not needed)
\item \char`\"{}-\/h\char`\"{} command (shortcut command)
\item \char`\"{}-\/-\/help\char`\"{} command (full command)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Compilation}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This program uses the autoconf / automake tool for the compilation.
\item To be able to compile, the following tools are necessary\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a U\+N\+I\+X like environment (Linux / cygwin for Windows)
\item the \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} command
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item For the compilation, run the following commands\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ./configure
\item make
\item make install
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Help can be found by using\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ./configure --help
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Getting the mpfr library (this library is only necessary for compiling for big numbers)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linux\+: \href{http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/#download}{\tt http\+://www.\+mpfr.\+org/mpfr-\/current/\#download}
\item Cygwin\+: \href{https://cygwin.com/install.html}{\tt https\+://cygwin.\+com/install.\+html} (use the setup to install the library)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Missing features (in development)}
